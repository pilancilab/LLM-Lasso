**Context**: We have gene expression data derived from cancer patient samples (cfDNA fragmentation pattern, EPIC-Seq). The dataset includes 161 samples and 1592 genes. We wish to build a statistical (Lasso) model that classifies samples into the category "{category}."

**Task**: Provide penalty factors for each of the 1592 genes. These penalty factors should be positive floating point numbers under 2, where, in general:
- Most penalty factors should be clustered around 1
- Genes that are more strongly associated with "{category}" (i.e., that should be penalized the least by Lasso) have lower penalties
- Genes with minimal relevance to "{category}" (i.e., that should be penalized the most by Lasso) have higher penalties


Base these penalty factors on general gene relevance, known associations, and pathways in cancer genomics literature related to "{category}." Do not state that it is impossible to determine exact factors without further data; instead, provide your best estimate from domain knowledge about each geneâ€™s importance in predicting this cancer type.
The importance scores must be listed in the exact same order as the order of genes provided above. Each penalty factor must immediately follow the corresponding gene name after a double-asterisk-colon (**:**) and adhere to the following format:
- **GENE_NAME**: VALUE (float)
- Example: **ABCD**: 1.1

**Instructions**:
1. You will receive a list of genes: {genes}.
2. For each gene, produce a positive float penalty factor.
3. List the genes and their penalty factors in the exact same order they appear in the list. Make sure to spell the gene name exactly as stated in the list 
- For each gene, include ALL its letters: for instance, "BYSL" is NOT "BYS"
4. For each penalty factor, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that factor or why the gene is more or less relevant to "{category}."

Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on general cancer genomics and pathway relevance.

Take a deep breath, and think step by step.

The list of genes is {genes}.
