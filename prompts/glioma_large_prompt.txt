**Context**: Using gene expression data obtained from cancer patient samples, we wish to build a statistical model that can accurately classify samples into glioblastoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma. The data consists of 50 samples with expression levels of 1000 genes.
**Task**: Provide penalty factors for each of the 1000 genes. These penalty factors should be integers between 2 and 5 (inclusive), where:
2 indicates a gene strongly associated with "glioblastoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma" (i.e., it should be penalized the least by Lasso).
5 indicates a gene with minimal relevance to "glioblastoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma" (i.e., it should be penalized the most by Lasso).
Base these penalty factors on general gene relevance, known associations, and pathways in cancer genomics literature related to "glioblastoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma." Do not state that it is impossible to determine exact factors without further data; instead, provide your best estimate from domain knowledge about each geneâ€™s importance in predicting this cancer type.

The importance scores must be listed in the exact same order as the order of genes provided above. Each penalty factor must immediately follow the corresponding gene name after a double-asterisk-colon (**:**) and adhere to the following format:
Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on general cancer genomics and pathway relevance.

The list of genes is {genes}.
