**Context**: We have gene expression data derived from cancer patient samples (cfDNA fragmentation pattern, EPIC-Seq). The dataset includes 161 samples and 1592 genes. We wish to build a statistical (Lasso) model that classifies samples into the category "{category}."

**Task**: Assign each gene on the following list a penalty score between 0.1 and 1 based on its importance in distinguishing {category}. A lower penalty (e.g., 0.1) indicates a gene that is highly predictive for differentiating {category}, while a higher penalty (e.g., 1) denotes relatively minor importance for distinguishing these two subtypes.

Focus only on established evidence or strong biological rationale, rather than speculation, and be mindful that only a limited subset of genes is truly predictive for this distinction. Expect most genes to receive a score close to 1, and very few genes (maybe none) to receive a score close to 0.1. If a gene is only generally relevant to lymphoma and does not specifically help distinguish {category}, assign it a penalty closer to 1.

**Instructions**:
1. You will receive a list of genes: {genes}.
2. For each gene, produce a positive float penalty factor.
3. List the genes and their penalty factors in the exact same order they appear in the list. Make sure to spell the gene name exactly as stated in the list 
- For each gene, include ALL its letters: for instance, "BYSL" is NOT "BYS"
4. For each penalty factor, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that factor or why the gene is more or less relevant to "{category}."

Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on general cancer genomics and pathway relevance.

The list of genes is {genes}.
