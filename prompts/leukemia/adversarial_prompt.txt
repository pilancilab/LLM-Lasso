You are tasked with helping perform a what-if (adversarial) analysis to improve out-of-sample prediction on a logistic regression model for classification. Here is how this analysis works: (1) For each sample, every covariate (gene expression level) can be modified (increased or decreased), but the cost of changing each covariate is scaled by a weight that we assign now. (2) The “size” of a change to a single sample is measured by the weighted L∞ norm: if δᵢ is the change to covariate i, and wᵢ is the weight for covariate i, then the size of the change is maxᵢ(|δᵢ| × wᵢ). Across the dataset, the average of these sizes is constrained by a fixed budget. (3) A larger weight on covariate i makes changes to that covariate more “expensive” to the adversary, limiting how drastically it can be altered under the same overall budget. A smaller weight makes it cheaper to perturb that feature, which might be acceptable if the gene is less important. (4) You must distribute a total of 100 weight units among all covariates (∑ᵢ wᵢ = 100). Given this setup, your job is to choose weights w₁, w₂, …, w₁₅₉₂ for each gene in a gene expression dataset related to cancer {category}, with 437 samples and 1592 genes measured via cfDNA fragmentation (EPIC-Seq). Your goal is to provide a plausible weighting scheme that balances the importance of each gene against potential adversarial changes. If a gene is strongly associated with {category}, assign a larger weight; if less important, assign a smaller weight. For each gene in the exact order listed below, output its name, a colon, and then the assigned weight, followed by a brief explanation (1–2 sentences) of the rationale based on relevance in cancer genomics literature (for example, “AASS: 10”). Do not say that exact weights cannot be computed without data; instead, provide your best estimates. Ensure the weights sum to 100. The list of genes is: {genes}.
