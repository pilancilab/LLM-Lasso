I would like you to provide penalty factors between (and including) 1 and 10 to use on each coefficient of a Lasso estimator based on domain knowledge for a regression or classification task. Higher penalty factors are used on less important genes, and lower penalty factors are used on more relevant genes. Please provide penalty factors for the following task: 
Using gene expression data obtained from cancer patient samples, we wish to build a statistical model that can accurately classify samples into {category}. The data consists of 161 samples with expression levels of 1592 genes. The data is inferred gene expression from cfDNA fragmentation pattern (EPIC-Seq). Prior to training the model, we first want to obtain penalty factors to use in training our model, as specified above. Your task is to provide penalty factors between (and including) 1 and 10 for each gene in predicting the cancer based on the gene's general associations, pathways, and relevance to {category} found in cancer genomics literature.
The list of genes is: {genes}. Produce these penalty factors for every single gene in the list. The penalty factors must be listed in the exact same order as the order of genes provided above. Produce the penalty factor a brief reasoning for each gene's importance in predicting this cancer type. Do not say that it's not possible to compute precise penalty factors without access to the actual gene expression values.
