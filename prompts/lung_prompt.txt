Please provide penalty factors (≥0, including ∞) for each gene to use in a Lasso estimator based on domain knowledge. Penalty factors λ_k determine the relative importance of regression coefficients β_k for feature k. Lasso with λ_k assumes Laplace priors, where the ratio of log-tail probabilities log P(||β_i|| > t) / log P(||β_j|| > t) equals λ_i / λ_j for all t. Larger λ_k implies less importance for feature k.
Task: Use gene expression data (161 samples, 1592 genes from EPIC-Seq cfDNA fragmentation) to classify samples into {category}. Assign penalty factors based on gene associations, pathways, and relevance to {category} from cancer genomics literature.
The list of genes is: {genes}. The penalty factors must be listed in the exact same order as the order of genes provided above. Each penalty factor must immediately follow the corresponding gene name after a double-asterisk-colon (**:**) and adhere to the following format:

- **GENE_NAME**: VALUE (float)
- Example: **AASS**: 0.5

Formatting Rules:
1. Score Representation:
   - Use a direct floating-point number for the value (e.g., 0.5).
   - Do not use scientific notation (e.g., 10**(-2) or 1e-2) or additional formatting (e.g., **0.5**).
2. Include All Genes:
   - Provide a penalty factor for every gene in the input list.
   - Maintain the same order as the list of genes provided.
3. Reasoning:
   - After the penalty factor, include a concise reasoning explaining the significance of the gene in predicting {category}.
4. Consistency:
   - Ensure the format is consistent for all entries.
   - Example for two genes:
     **AASS**: 1
     Reasoning: This gene is highly expressed in cancer pathways and has been associated with {category} in previous studies. Therefore, we assign a low penalty factor.
     **BRCA1**: 5
     Reasoning: BRCA1 is not known to play a significant role in predicting {category}. Therefore, we assign a high penalty factor.

Key Consideration:
- Do not say that it’s not possible to compute precise penalty factors without access to the actual gene expression values. Produce these penalty factors for all the genes.

Ensure that all genes are included and strictly adhere to the format above. Responses not following these guidelines will be considered invalid.
