I would like you to provide penalty factors greater than or equal to 0 (excluding infinity) to use on each coefficient of a Lasso estimator based on domain knowledge for a regression or classification task. Suppose beta_k is the regression coefficient for feature k. We interpret Lasso with penalty factors lambda_k as yielding a maximum a posteriori estimate under Laplace priors with parameters lambda_k. This means that, before observing the data, the ratio of log-tail probabilities log P( \|beta_i\| \> t ) / log P( \|beta_j\| \> t ) is equal to lambda_i / lambda_j for each i,j for all t. Therefore, the penalty factors are relative log-tail-probabilities of coefficients. For example, if feature A has a penalty factor of lambda and feature B has a penalty factor of 2\*lambda, this means the log-likelihood that the absolute value of the regression coefficient for A exceeds any threshold is twice that of B. Thus, the larger the penalty factor is for a coefficient, the less "important" the coefficient is. Based on this framework, please provide penalty factors for the following task:
Using gene expression data obtained from T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient samples, we wish to build a statistical model that can accurately classify samples into early T cell precursor (ETP) T-ALL and non-ETP T-ALL. The data consists of 189 samples with expression levels of 1000 genes. Prior to training the model, we first want to obtain penalty factors to use in training our model, as specified above. Your task is to provide penalty factors greater than or equal to 0 (excluding infinity) for each gene in predicting ETP T-ALL based on the gene's general associations, pathways, and relevance to ETP T-ALL found in cancer genomics literature.
The list of genes is: {genes}. The penalty factors must be listed in the exact same order as the order of genes provided above. Each penalty factor must immediately follow the corresponding gene name after a double-asterisk-colon (**:**) and adhere to the following format: **GENE_NAME**: VALUE (float) (for Example: **AASS**: 0.5), and should include each gene in the list. Start with the penalty factor, followed by a brief reasoning for each gene's importance in predicting this cancer type. Do not say that it's not possible to compute precise penalty factors without access to the actual gene expression values. Produce these penalty factors for all the genes.
