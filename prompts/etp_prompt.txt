**Context**: Using gene expression data obtained from T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient samples, we wish to build a statistical model that can accurately classify samples into early T cell precursor (ETP) T-ALL and non-ETP T-ALL. The data consists of 189 samples with expression levels of 1000 genes. These penalty factors should be integers between 2 and 5 (inclusive), where:
2 indicates a gene strongly associated with "{category}" (i.e., it should be penalized the least by Lasso).
5 indicates a gene with minimal relevance to "{category}" (i.e., it should be penalized the most by Lasso).
Base these penalty factors on general gene relevance, known associations, and pathways in cancer genomics literature related to "{category}." Do not state that it is impossible to determine exact factors without further data; instead, provide your best estimate from domain knowledge about each gene's importance in predicting this cancer type.
**Instructions**:
1. You will receive a list of genes: {genes}.
2. For each gene, produce an integer penalty factor from 2 to 5.
3. List the genes and their penalty factors in the exact same order they appear in the list.
4. For each penalty factor, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that factor or why the gene is more or less relevant to "{category}."

**Your Response**:
Must contain one entry per gene, each entry including:
- The gene name.
- The penalty factor.
- A succinct reasoning for that factor.
Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on general cancer genomics and pathway relevance.

The list of genes is {genes}.
