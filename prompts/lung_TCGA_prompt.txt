We have bulk RNA sequencing data derived from lung cancer samples. The dataset includes 1017 samples and 1000 genes. We wish to build a statistical (Lasso) model that classifies samples into the category "lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)".

**Task**: Provide penalty factors for each of the genes provided. These penalty factors should be integers between 2 and 5 (inclusive), where:
- 2 indicates a gene strongly associated with "LUAD and LUSC" (i.e., it should be penalized the least by Lasso).
- 5 indicates a gene with minimal relevance to "LUAD and LUSC" (i.e., it should be penalized the most by Lasso).
Base these penalty factors on general gene relevance, known associations, and pathways in cancer genomics literature related to "LUAD and LUSC". Do not state that it is impossible to determine exact factors without further data; instead, provide your best estimate from domain knowledge about each geneâ€™s importance in predicting this cancer type.
The penalty factors must be listed in the exact same order as the order of genes provided above.

**Instructions**:
1. You will receive a list of genes.
2. For each gene, produce an integer penalty factor from 2 to 5.
3. For each penalty factor, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that factor or why the gene is more or less relevant to classifying "lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)".

Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on general cancer genomics and pathway relevance.

The list of genes is: {genes}
