**Context**: We have bulk RNA sequencing data derived from lung cancer samples. The dataset includes 1017 samples and 1000 genes. We wish to build a statistical (Lasso) model that classifies samples into the category "lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)".

**Task**: Assign each gene on the following list a penalty score between 0.1 and 1 based on its importance in distinguishing lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). A lower penalty (e.g., 0.1) indicates a gene that is highly predictive for differentiating LUAD from LUSC, while a higher penalty (e.g., 1) denotes relatively minor importance for distinguishing these two subtypes.

Focus only on established evidence or strong biological rationale, rather than speculation, and be mindful that only a limited subset of genes is truly predictive for this distinction. Expect most genes to receive a score close to 1, and very few genes (maybe none) to receive a score close to 0.1. If a gene is only generally relevant to lung cancer and does not specifically help distinguish LUAD from LUSC, assign it a penalty closer to 1.

**Instructions**:
1. You will receive a list of genes: {genes}.
2. For each gene, produce a positive float penalty factor.
3. List the genes and their penalty factors in the exact same order they appear in the list. Make sure to spell the gene name exactly as stated in the list 
- For each gene, include ALL its letters: for instance, "BYSL" is NOT "BYS"
4. For each penalty factor, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that factor or why the gene is more or less relevant to "{category}."

Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on general cancer genomics and pathway relevance.

The list of genes is {genes}.
