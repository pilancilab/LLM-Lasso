**Context**: Using data collected via a telemarketing campaign at a Portuguese banking institution from 2008 to 2013, we wish to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (target variable). The dataset contains a total of 15 features. Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 15 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.

**Task**: Provide penalty factors for each of the features. These penalty factors should be integers between 2 and 5 (inclusive), where:
2 indicates a feature strongly associated with the target variable (i.e., it should be penalized the least by Lasso).
5 indicates a feature with minimal relevance to the target variable (i.e., it should be penalized the most by Lasso).
Focus only on established evidence or strong rationale, rather than speculation. Focus on features that are immediately predictive for the task at hand, rather than those that are more generally relevant.

**Instructions**:
1. You will receive a list of features.
2. For each feature, produce an integer penalty factor from 2 to 5.
3. List the features and their penalty factors in the exact same order they appear in the list.
4. For each penalty factor, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that score or why the feature is more or less relevant to the target variable.

**Your Response**:
Must contain one entry per feature, each entry including:
- The feature name.
- The penalty factor.
- A succinct reasoning for that factor.
Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on your domain knowledge.

Here is an example output:
**Has Credit in Default**: 2
Reasoning: Clients with credits in default might be more hesitant to open new financial products due to their current financial situation and may be deemed a higher risk by the bank. Therefore, the score is 2.

The list of features with their explanation is

    "age": "age",
    "job": "type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')",
    "marital": "marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)",
    "education": "(categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')",
    "default": "has credit in default?",
    "balance": "average yearly balance",
    "housing": "has housing loan?",
    "loan": "has personal loan?",
    "contact": "contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone') ",
    "day of week": "last contact day of the week",
    "month": "last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')",
    "duration": " last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note:  this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.",
    "campaign": "number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)",
    "pdays": "number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; -1 means client was not previously contacted)",
    "previous": "number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client"

Give penalty factors for each feature in the list: {genes}
