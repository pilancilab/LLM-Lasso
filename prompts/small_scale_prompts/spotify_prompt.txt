**Context**: Using data from the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" dataset, we aim to build a machine learning model to predict the number of Spotify streams (target variable). The dataset contains a total of 22 features, including quantitative features like Track Score, All Time Rank. Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 22 features that are most important for reliably predicting the number of Spotify streams.
**Task**: Provide penalty factors for each of the features. These penalty factors should be integers between 2 and 5 (inclusive), where:
2 indicates a feature strongly associated with "{category}" (i.e., it should be penalized the least by Lasso).
5 indicates a feature with minimal relevance to "{category}" (i.e., it should be penalized the most by Lasso).
Base these penalty factors on general feature relevance related to "{category}." Do not state that it is impossible to determine exact factors without further data; instead, provide your best estimate from domain knowledge about each featureâ€™s importance in predicting this target.
**Instructions**:
1. You will receive a list of features: {genes}.
2. For each feature, produce an integer penalty factor from 2 to 5.
3. List the features and their penalty factors in the exact same order they appear in the list.
4. For each penalty factor, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that score or why the feature is more or less relevant to the target variable.

**Your Response**:
Must contain one entry per feature, each entry including:
- The feature name.
- The penalty factor.
- A succinct reasoning for that factor.
Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on your domain knowledge.

Here is an example output:
**Track Score**: 2
Reasoning: Track Score is a composite metric that incorporates multiple factors influencing a song's performance. A high Track Score is strongly correlated with higher Spotify streams, making this feature highly relevant.

The list of features is {genes}.
