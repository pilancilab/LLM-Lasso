This is a set of physicochemical measurements taken from red and white vinho verde wine samples produced in northern Portugal. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a wine is high or low quality.
T means the variable is important for predicting wine quality,  
F means the variable is not important for predicting wine quality.  
The goal is to remove nuisance variables.

Variable: Fixed acidity  
Description: Concentration of non-volatile acids (primarily tartaric acid) in g/dm³  
Answer: T  
Explanation: Fixed acidity directly affects the taste and structure of wine. It plays a crucial role in determining balance and mouthfeel, both important for quality assessment.

Variable: Density  
Description: Density of the wine, closely related to sugar and alcohol content  
Answer: T  
Explanation: Density reflects the residual sugar and alcohol content, both of which affect the wine's body and sweetness—key quality indicators.
