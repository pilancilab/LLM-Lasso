I would like you to provide penalty factors greater than or equal to 0
(and including infinity) to use on each coefficient of a Lasso estimator
based on domain knowledge for a regression or classification task.
Suppose beta_k is the regression coefficient for feature k. We interpret
Lasso with penalty factors lambda_k as yielding a maximum a posteriori
estimate under Laplace priors with parameters lambda_k. This means that,
before observing the data, the ratio of log-tail probabilities log P(
\|beta_i\| \> t ) / log P( \|beta_j\| \> t ) is equal to lambda_i /
lambda_j for each i,j for all t. Therefore, the penalty factors are
relative log-tail-probabilities of coefficients. For example, if feature
A has a penalty factor of lambda and feature B has a penalty factor of
2\*lambda, this means the log-likelihood that the absolute value of the
regression coefficient for A exceeds any threshold is twice that of B.
Thus, the larger the penalty factor is for a coefficient, the less
"important" the coefficient is. Based on this framework, please provide
penalty factors for the following task:

Using gene expression data obtained from cancer patient samples, we wish to
build a statistical model that can accurately classify samples into
{category} and a healthy
control. The data consists of 437 samples with expression levels of
1592 genes. The data is inferred gene expression from cfDNA
fragmentation pattern (EPIC-Seq). Prior to training the model, we first
want to obtain penalty factors to use in training our model, as
specified above. Your task is to provide penalty factors greater than or
equal to 0 (and including infinity) for each gene in predicting the
cancer {category} based on the gene's general associations, pathways, and relevance to cancer {category} found in cancer genomics literature.

The list of genes are: {genes}.
The scores should be listed in the same order as the order of genes provided above followed immediately after the colon (for instance, **AASS**: 3),
and should include each gene in the list. Start with the score, followed by a brief reasoning for each gene's importance in predicting this cancer type.
Do not say that it's not possible to compute precise importance scores without access to the actual gene expression values.
Produce these importance scores for all the genes.
