Context: Using data collected via a telemarketing campaign at a Portuguese banking institution from 2008 to 2013, we wish to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (target variable). The dataset contains a total of 15 features (e.g., age, marital status, whether the client has a housing loan). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 15 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.

Formatting: Each importance score must immediately follow the corresponding feature name after a double-asterisk-colon (**:**) and adhere to the following format:
1. For each feature, produce an importance score from 0 to 1.
2. List the features and their importance scores in the exact same order they appear in the list.
3. For each importance score, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that score or why the feature is more or less relevant to the target variable.

Here is an example output:
**Has Credit in Default**: 0.9
Reasoning: Clients with credits in default might be more hesitant to open new financial products due to their current financial situation and may be deemed a higher risk by the bank. Therefore, the score is 0.9.

Provide a score and reasoning for features
    "age": "age",
    "job": "type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')",
    "marital": "marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)",
    "education": "(categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')",
    "default": "has credit in default?",
    "balance": "average yearly balance",
    "housing": "has housing loan?",
    "loan": "has personal loan?",
    "contact": "contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone') ",
    "day of week": "last contact day of the week",
    "month": "last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')",
    "duration": " last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note:  this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.",
    "campaign": "number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)",
    "pdays": "number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; -1 means client was not previously contacted)",
    "previous": "number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client"

formatted according to the output schema above:

The features are {genes}.
