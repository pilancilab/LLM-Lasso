**Context**: We have gene expression data derived from cancer patient samples (cfDNA fragmentation pattern, EPIC-Seq). We wish to build a statistical (Lasso) model that classifies samples into the category "{category}."
**Task**: Provide penalty factors for each of the 1592 genes. These penalty factors should be integers between 1 and 5 (inclusive), where:
2 indicates a gene strongly associated with "{category}" (i.e., it should be penalized the least by Lasso).
5 indicates a gene with minimal relevance to "{category}" (i.e., it should be penalized the most by Lasso).
Base these penalty factors on general gene relevance, known associations, and pathways in cancer genomics literature related to "{category}." Do not state that it is impossible to determine exact factors without further data; instead, provide your best estimate from domain knowledge about each geneâ€™s importance in predicting this cancer type.
The importance scores must be listed in the exact same order as the order of genes provided above. Each penalty factor must immediately follow the corresponding gene name after a double-asterisk-colon (**:**) and adhere to the following format:
- **GENE_NAME**: VALUE (float)
- Example: **AASS**: 1
**Instructions**:
1. You will receive a list of genes: {genes}.
2. For each gene, produce an integer penalty factor from 1 to 5.
3. List the genes and their penalty factors in the exact same order they appear in the list.
- Note that letter "I" is not number "1", so do not write "ARSI" as "ARS1".
- For each gene, include ALL its letters: for instance, "BYSL" is NOT "BYS"
4. For each penalty factor, provide a brief statement of how you arrived at that factor or why the gene is more or less relevant to "{category}."

Do not include disclaimers about lacking full data; rely on general cancer genomics and pathway relevance.

The list of genes is {genes}.
